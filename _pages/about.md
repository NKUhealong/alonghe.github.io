<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the National Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science on Synthetic Vision, the College of Computer Science, Nankai University, co-advised by Prof. Tao Li. I was sponsored by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and participated in a joint doctoral training program at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore from September 2022 to September 2023, under the supervision of Dr Huazhu Fu.

My research interest includes medical image analysis and computer vision.
